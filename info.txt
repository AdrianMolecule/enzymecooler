from scott:


As for the enzyme cooler, they basically are designed to hold 2mL screw cap microcentrifuge tubes. The diameter of one of the holes in my cooler is just shy of 1/2” and the depth is about 1.5”. How many holes is up to you. The one I showed you had 12 holes (3x4) and for starters that is probably all you need. You might be able to use a yogurt or margarine container as the base or get a kitchen container from Canadian Tire or Ikea. Here are some examples of commercial coolers:

The space surrounding the tubes is filled with a sealed-in material that maintains the low temperature required for safe storage and transport. When the container is taken out of a –20°C freezer, it will maintain a –15°C temperature for 1.5 hours and will remain below 0°C for four hours."

how long does the defrost cycle lasts?  A: The heating coils turn on and remain on for about 20 to 40 minutes


80% MethOH, 20% EtOH, Wax, you add 2/3 of the final volume of MetOH/EtOH solution into shredded  wax

I though I have mentioned before!.. my bad if not
7:24
we used to do that in my chemical lessons for keeping extract from secondary metabolites from the rota-vapor extraction
7:26
if you dont have MetOH you can use isoprop. alcohol (rubbibg alcohol) and works the same
7:28
solid alcohol is also the same idea
7:31
Thermo actually sell something like that that you only pour IPA (IsoPropylic Alcochol or rubbing alcohol) into that and that's it... hold on,

it works for either slowly cooling down cells or for keeping samples/enzymes/ thermolabile material etc...

Ha ha, yeap,  so the only challenge is getting those wells. And no issue with the IPA procurement

does it spill if you turn it on an angle?
