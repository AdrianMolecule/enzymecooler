temp logger

Here's a good explaination about how defrosting cycle works:

We need to measure the temperature for several days to first get a baseline and then to caracterize the enzyme cooler performance


Step 1 - load PI with the software
	download Pi imager and run in Windows with a <256 gb memory stick https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/

	I used this as a starting point: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-11-ds18b20-temperature-sensing?view=all
	or https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-11-ds18b20-temperature-sensing?view=all

	Not this: https://wokwi.com/projects/381046663972674561

	also this: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/temperature-log/1
Step 2 - assemble the hardware
	Connect the PI and temp sensor according to the schematic in the easyEDA project directory. Also present as a .pdf export in the \temperature logger directory
Step 3 collect data
	Run the data collection script from the software directory for several days.
	You can work on PI directly or ssh a@raspberrypi.local from Putty/Power Shell and enter the password. Dfault is raspberry but it's better to change it to N...
	can ssh ssh a@pi.loc
Step 4 graph the temperature
	After collecting enough days in the logfile.txt run the graphing script in the software directory
